1. Swap 2 numbers without temp variable

    Approach: A,B
              A = A+B
              B = A-B
              A = A-B

    Approach:map.entrySet().stream().sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).forEach(System.out::println);

3. We have N number of tickets each have source and destination, which DS will help to find the start and end place

4. What is the Diff between NetConf and RestConf
    NetConf is StateFull and more into Configuration where RestConf is stateLess and more into handling web request
    like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and PATCH

5. What is Must , When and Unique in YANG file.
    In YANG, the must statement is used to define constraints on data nodes using XPath expressions. These constraints must evaluate to true for the data to be considered valid. Here's a basic example to illustrate how the must statement works:

    module example-module {
        namespace "http://example.com/example-module";
        prefix "ex";

        container example-container {
            leaf example-leaf {
                type string;
                must "string-length(.) >= 5" {
                    error-message "The string length must be at least 5 characters.";
                }
            }
        }
    }

    In YANG, the when statement is used to conditionally include or exclude a data node based on an XPath expression. This means that the data node will only be present if the condition specified in the when statement evaluates to true

    In YANG, ensuring uniqueness within a list can be achieved using the key statement. The key statement specifies one or more leafs that uniquely identify list entries.
    key "username email";

 6. Why GNMI is efitient for telemetry over SNMP protocol
    gNMI uses a streaming protocol to collect data, which is more efficient than SNMP's polling-based approach. This reduces the load on network devices and allows for real-time data collection
    gNMI supports sustained streaming connections, allowing network devices to continuously send updates to the client. This is in contrast to SNMP, which typically uses a request/response pattern

 18. What are SOLID principle
    The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software
    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This helps in making the class more cohesive and easier to maintain1.

    Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code2.

    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass2.

    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means creating smaller, more specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface2.

    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions2.

                String str = "Java123";
                String str1 = "Java";

                System.out.println(str.compareTo(str1));//3
                System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str));//-3

            }
        }

  20. Output of:

 22. How to read properties file values in springboot
     @Value("${data.user}") for individual properties

     Using @ConfigurationProperties: For more complex configurations, you can use the @ConfigurationProperties annotation to bind a group of properties to a POJO.
     @Configuration
     @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "my")
     public class MyProperties {}

     @Component
     public class MyComponent {

     @Autowired
     private Environment env;

     public void printProperty() {
         String myProperty = env.getProperty("my.property");
         System.out.println("Property value: " + myProperty);
     }

23. How to avoid a class from @Autowired in springboot

    Ensure that the class is not annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository,
    or any other stereotype annotations that make it a Spring-managed bean

    excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, classes = MyClass.class))

24. Write string polyndrom program

25. Implement stack push , pop, peek methods

26. What is composition and aggregation
    Composition
    Definition: Composition is a strong form of association where the child object cannot exist independently of the parent object. If the parent object is destroyed, the child objects are also destroyed.
    Example: A House and its Rooms. If the House is destroyed, the Rooms no longer exist.

    Aggregation
    Definition: Aggregation is a weaker form of association where the child object can exist independently of the parent object. The parent and child have their own life cycles.
    Example: A Library and Books. If the Library is destroyed, the Books can still exist.

 32. How to mock static method in Junit
    mockito-inline

    public class StaticUtils {
        public static String getVal() {
            return "foo";
        }
    }

    public class StaticUtilsTest {

        @Test
        void testGetVal() {
            // Outside the mock scope
            assertEquals("foo", StaticUtils.getVal());

            // Mocking the static method
            try (MockedStatic<StaticUtils> mockedStatic = mockStatic(StaticUtils.class)) {
                mockedStatic.when(StaticUtils::getVal).thenReturn("bar");

                // Inside the mock scope
                assertEquals("bar", StaticUtils.getVal());
            }

            // Outside the mock scope again
            assertEquals("foo", StaticUtils.getVal());
        }
    }

    Add Dependencies: Ensure you have the mockito-inline dependency.
    Create Static Method: Define a class with a static method to be mocked.
    Mock Static Method: Use MockedStatic to mock the static method within a try-with-resources block.
    This ensures the mock is only active within the block and the static method returns to its original behavior afterward.

    Mockito: Starting from version 3.4.0, Mockito supports mocking static methods directly using the mockito-inline module12.
    Scoped Mocking: Use MockedStatic within a try-with-resources block to ensure the mock is scoped and does not affect other tests.

 49.When we prefor TCP and when we prefor UDP

    When to Prefer TCP
    Reliability: TCP provides reliable data transfer with error checking and recovery. If your application requires guaranteed delivery of data, TCP is the better choice.
    Ordered Delivery: TCP ensures that data packets are delivered in the same order they were sent. This is crucial for applications where the order of data matters, such as file transfers or web browsing.
    Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a connection before data transfer, ensuring a stable communication channel. This is important for applications that need a persistent connection, like email or remote server access (SSH).
    Flow Control and Congestion Control: TCP manages data flow and network congestion, making it suitable for applications that require smooth data transmission, such as streaming services.
    When to Prefer UDP
    Speed: UDP is faster than TCP because it has less overhead. It does not establish a connection or perform error checking, making it suitable for applications where speed is critical.
    Low Latency: UDP is ideal for real-time applications that require low latency, such as online gaming, VoIP (Voice over IP), and live video streaming.
    Broadcast and Multicast: UDP supports broadcasting and multicasting, making it suitable for applications that need to send data to multiple recipients simultaneously, like DNS queries or video conferencing.
    Simple Protocol: UDP is simpler and more efficient for applications that can tolerate some data loss, such as sensor data collection or logging.
    Summary
    Use TCP: When you need reliability, ordered delivery, and connection-oriented communication.
    Use UDP: When you need speed, low latency, and can tolerate some data loss.

 50. if microservice sends same request to other what will happen?
    1. Idempotent Operations
    If the receiving microservice's operation is idempotent, sending the same request multiple times will have the same effect as sending it once. Idempotent operations ensure that repeated requests do not cause unintended side effects.
    Example: Updating a user's profile information. If the same update request is sent multiple times, the user's profile will be updated to the same state each time.
    2. Non-Idempotent Operations
    If the operation is not idempotent, sending the same request multiple times can lead to unintended consequences, such as duplicate entries or inconsistent states.
    Example: Creating a new order. If the same order creation request is sent multiple times, it could result in multiple orders being created.

 51. Write a query to fetch the department-wise count of employees sorted by department’s count in ascending order.

 56. About @Joincolumn in JPA
    @Entity
    public class Employee {

        @Id
        private Long id;

        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
        private Department department;

        // Other fields, getters, and setters
    }

    @Entity
    public class Department {

        @Id
        private Long id;

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
        private List<Employee> employees;

        // Other fields, getters, and setters
    }
    The Employee entity has a ManyToOne relationship with the Department entity.
    The @JoinColumn annotation in the Employee entity specifies that the foreign key column in the Employee table will be department_id.

 57. @Version in JPA
    The @Version annotation marks a property as the version field, which is automatically updated by the persistence provider (e.g., Hibernate) whenever the entity is updated.

 58. What are the JPA methods
    1.Persist->void persist(Object entity);->Persists an entity into the database
    2.Find-><T> T find(Class<T> entityClass, Object primaryKey);->Finds an entity by its primary key
    3.Merge-><T> T merge(T entity);->Merges the state of the given entity into the current persistence context.
    4.Remove->void remove(Object entity);->Removes an entity from the database
    5.CreateQuery->Query createQuery(String qlString);->Creates a query from a JPQL string
    6.CreateNamedQuery->Query createNamedQuery(String name);->Creates a query using native SQL.
    7.Flush->void flush();->Synchronizes the persistence context to the underlying database.
    8.Clear->void clear();->Clears the persistence context, causing all managed entities to become detached
    9.GetTransaction->EntityTransaction getTransaction();

 59. Difference between CreateQuery and CreatedNamedQuery
    This method is used to create a dynamic query at runtime using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).
    Usage: The query string is passed directly to the createQuery method.

    This method is used to execute a named query that is predefined and annotated in the entity class or defined in a mapping file.
    Dynamic vs. Static:
    createQuery allows for dynamic query creation at runtime, while createNamedQuery uses predefined, static named queries.
    Flexibility vs. Reusability: createQuery offers more flexibility for dynamic queries, whereas createNamedQuery promotes reusability and consistency with named queries.

    String jpql = "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.price > :price";
    Query query = entityManager.createQuery(jpql);
    query.setParameter("price", 100);
    List<Product> results = query.getResultList();

    @Entity
    @NamedQuery(name = "Product.findByPrice", query = "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.price > :price")
    public class Product {}
